# Python Data Types and Casting - Practice Exercises

# 1. Basic Type Identification
# Identify the data types of the following variables and print them.

a = 42
b = 3.14
c = "Hello, World!"
d = [1, 2, 3, 4]
e = (5, 6, 7, 8)
f = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
g = {9, 10, 11, 12}
h = True

# Use the `type()` function to print the data types of each variable.

# 2. Type Casting Exercises
# Perform type casting on the following variables.

# a) Convert `b` to an integer and print it.
# b) Convert `c` to a list of characters and print it.
# c) Convert `d` to a tuple and print it.
# d) Convert `h` to an integer and print it.
# e) Convert `a` to a float and print it.

# 3. Type Conversion and Mathematical Operations
# Given the following:

x = "123"  # string
y = 4.56  # float

# a) Convert `x` to an integer and add it to `y`. Print the result.
# b) Convert `y` to an integer and add it to `x` (after converting `x` to an integer as well). Print the result.

# 4. Advanced Type Casting
# Given a list of mixed data types:

mixed_list = [1, "2", 3.5, "4.8", True]

# a) Convert each element to an integer if possible and store them in a new list called `int_list`.
# b) Print the `int_list`.

print("Ex_final ", mixed_list)
